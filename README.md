# WideBand-Sprial-Antenna-for-UAVs
This project consists of a CST (Computer Simulation Technology) simulation of a wideband spiral antenna, especially designed for UAVs. 


The two major (and common) communication links between a UAV and a GCS (Ground Control Station) are: <br />
* Telemetry at 915MHz
* Live Video Feed at 2.4/5.8GHz  <br />

The above two requires to have separate communication systems, along with separate antennas at the UAV. Our spiral antenna design obviates the need for separate antennas at the UAV, thus reducing payload weight and hence an increased flight time. 
<br />


The designed spiral antenna has below characteristics:
* Wideband
* Omni-directional
* Lightweight
* Compact
<br />

Please see the report for technical details and simulation results.
